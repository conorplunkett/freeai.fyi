# FreeAI Terminal

Standalone Claude Code terminal integration.

## Commands

```bash
cd terminal
npm test
node bin/freeai.js claude setup
```

| Command | What |
| --- | --- |
| `freeai claude setup` | Locate the real `claude`, store it in `~/.freeai/claude/config.json`, add a marked shell alias/function, then prompt to link your FreeAI account by email. Pass `--email YOU@EXAMPLE.COM` to link non-interactively, or `--no-link` to skip. |
| `freeai claude link [--email …]` | Email yourself a magic link that attributes this machine's Claude Code credits to your FreeAI account. Run it any time after setup. |
| `freeai claude run [...args]` | Internal wrapper used by the alias. It forwards args, cwd, env, stdio, signals, and Claude's exit code. |
| `freeai claude restore` | Remove the marked shell block. Safe to run repeatedly. |
| `freeai claude doctor` | Print the resolved Claude path, config/shell/rc paths, then probe the backend pipeline (config → ads → device → account → click-intent) and report an `adsWillServe` verdict. The `account` step shows whether this device is linked to your FreeAI account. Pass `--no-backend` to skip the network probe. |

## Account Linking

Credits earned in the terminal accrue to an anonymous **device** (`~/.freeai/device.json`)
until that device is linked to a FreeAI account. Linking emails you a magic link
(`POST /v1/auth/request-link`); clicking it (`/v1/auth/verify`) sets the device's
`user_id`, after which Claude Code credits show up in your portal balance. This is
the same device→account flow the Chrome extension popup uses. Until you link, the
`account` step in `freeai claude doctor` reports `linked: false`.

### Debugging "no ad shows"

The ad path is silent in normal use, so `doctor` can be green on the local
machine while no ad serves. Two diagnostics:

- `freeai claude doctor` — the `adsWillServe` field plus per-step `ok`/`error`
  shows whether the backend pipeline succeeds (network reachable, ad in
  rotation, device + click-intent created).
- `FREEAI_DEBUG=1 claude` — traces to stderr whether the wrapper ran and which
  step, if any, caused it to fall back to plain `claude`. No `freeai[debug]`
  output means the shell alias isn't active (`type claude` to confirm).

`setup` adds a marked, reversible shell alias/function so `claude ...` becomes
`freeai claude run ...`. zsh/bash use:

```sh
alias claude="freeai claude run"
```

fish uses an equivalent `claude` function that forwards `$argv`.

## Uninstall

```bash
freeai claude restore        # remove the shell alias/function
# restart your shell, or source your rc
npm rm -g @freeai/terminal   # remove the CLI (if installed globally)
rm -rf ~/.freeai             # optional: delete local state (device + config)
```

`restore` removes only the marked shell block; it never touched your real
`claude` binary, the npm shim, or `~/.claude/settings.json`, so Claude Code keeps
working unchanged. If `freeai` is already gone, delete the marked block from your
rc file by hand. Deleting `~/.freeai` removes the device credentials — link your
account by email first (`freeai claude link`) if you want unlinked earnings to
follow your account.

## Claude Code Integration

Reference surfaces:

- Claude Code status line docs: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/statusline
- Claude Code `--settings` CLI docs: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/cli-reference

The wrapper launches the real Claude Code binary with a temporary `--settings`
file containing a FreeAI `statusLine` command. It preserves any user-supplied
`--settings` value by parsing and merging it into the temporary settings file,
then chains any pre-existing effective user/project/local `statusLine`.

The status line command receives Claude Code's JSON status payload on stdin. It
uses `transcript_path` plus structural transcript rows to decide whether Claude
is actively thinking. When active, it prints one clickable OSC 8 `ad· <line>`
that points at a `/v1/go/:token` URL from `/v1/clicks/intent`. When idle, it
prints only the user's original status line, or nothing.

It never edits the real Claude binary, npm shim, or persistent
`~/.claude/settings.json`. If config, ad fetch, device registration, click-intent
creation, settings parsing, or any other FreeAI preparation step fails, `run`
executes Claude unchanged.

Hooks are intentionally not used in v1. The supported integration surface is
Claude Code `statusLine` plus a session-scoped `--settings` file.

## State And Billing

Runtime state is stored under `~/.freeai/claude/sessions/<session-id>/` and is
removed when Claude exits. Device credentials are stored in `~/.freeai`, matching
the existing Chrome extension device-credit backend.

An impression is emitted to `/v1/events` only after 5 continuous active seconds
with a fresh statusline heartbeat. Clicks use `/v1/clicks/intent` tracking URLs;
the terminal client does not self-report click counts through `/v1/events`.

## Backend Configuration

The default API base is the production Supabase Edge Function. It can be
overridden with `~/.freeai/config.json`:

```json
{
  "backendBaseUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:8787"
}
```

or with `FREEAI_BASE` when no config file override is set.

## Tests

```bash
make test-terminal
# or
cd terminal && npm test
```
