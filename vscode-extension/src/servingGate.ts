/** Central serving gate — the ONE predicate every ad-patch writer consults
 *  before touching user files or handing an ad to a webview (wave 2, audit
 *  2026-06-09 findings #3/#4/#6/#9/#14/#19).
 *
 *  Pre-fix, several independent timers (the 60s debug reassert, the rotation
 *  tick, the 60s cliSync loop, boot-canary patching, the webview reasserts,
 *  the live loopback /ad route) each re-applied the ad patch without
 *  consulting the global gates, so a killed or user-disabled install
 *  oscillated restore→re-patch forever. The gate owns the three inputs and
 *  every writer asks it first:
 *
 *    1. kill posture — "clear" (healthy), "confirmed" (a 200 from
 *       /v1/killswitch said killed:true), or "offline" (the endpoint was
 *       unreachable / non-200 — we genuinely don't know). The split is the
 *       kill HYSTERESIS: confirmed ⇒ restore everything; offline ⇒ FREEZE
 *       (no restore, no new writes) so a wifi blip never churns the user's
 *       Claude Code install while staying fail-closed for new writes.
 *    2. the user master toggle — wired by extension.ts to the
 *       DebugController's persisted intent. A deliberate "Disable FreeAI"
 *       / Restore command reads disabled here; the sign-out pause (K_ON
 *       forced false but K_PRESIGNOUT remembered) stays ENABLED so the
 *       signed-out demo flow keeps working (the Wave-1 sign-out contract).
 *    3. crash-canary suspension — "skip automatic patch this run". Session-
 *       scoped; lifted only by an explicit user re-enable (setOn(true)),
 *       matching the canary toast's wording.
 *
 *  Module-scoped singleton (same idiom as adRotation's sign-out hook):
 *  exactly one serving posture exists per extension host, and the writers
 *  live in modules that don't all share an ActivationContext. activate()
 *  resets it; tests reset via resetServingGate(). Every read is guarded —
 *  the gate itself can never throw into a writer (prime directive). */
