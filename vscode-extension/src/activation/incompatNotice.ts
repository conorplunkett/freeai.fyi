/** One-time-per-version warning when Claude Code is genuinely unpatchable.
 *
 *  Tightly gated so the known transient/cosmetic "incompatible" flash never
 *  nags the user:
 *   - only the structural "verb array not found" miss — a real adapter probe
 *     miss. "target not found" (CC absent) and transient apply/port failures
 *     never fire here.
 *   - never when the live file already carries our block: isPatched() ⇒ the ad
 *     is serving and the label was a stale flash.
 *   - deduped per CC version in globalState, so a reload never re-nags and only
 *     a NEW breaking version notifies again.
 *
 *  Best-effort: never throws, never blocks activation.
