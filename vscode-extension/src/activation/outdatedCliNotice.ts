/** One-time-per-version warning when the terminal `claude` CLI is POSITIVELY
 *  detected older than the spinnerVerbs floor (2.1.143). On those builds the
 *  spinner-verb ad surface is silently ignored, so the user sees stock verbs
 *  and never learns their CLI is the reason — and their share never accrues
 *  from that surface. We surface it instead of failing silent.
 *
 *  Gated like notifyIncompatible:
 *   - caller only invokes this on a positively-detected old version, never on
 *     the fail-open (undetectable / absent CLI) path — see SpinnerSupport.
 *   - deduped per detected version in globalState, so a reload never re-nags
 *     and only a different old version notifies again.
 *
 *  Best-effort: never throws, never blocks activation.
