// Regression: a transient injection miss (loopback port race on

// still-live, ad-serving block as "incompatible". This was the cosmetic
// "FreeAI incompatible" label users saw while ads were actually serving.
// The first param is "ANY webview target patched" (S9 dual target) — a live
// Codex block keeps the label honest exactly like a live Claude Code block;
// the union is pinned in webviewInjection-dualtarget.test.ts.
